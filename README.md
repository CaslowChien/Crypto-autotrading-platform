## Project Introduction
Our goal: "Empowering Traders to Automate Their Strategies: A Modular Trading Platform for Non-Programmers"

We have developed a modular trading platform that allows traders, even those without programming skills, to easily automate their strategies. By eliminating the need for manual monitoring and emotional impacts from market fluctuations, traders can now seamlessly translate their strategies into automated actions.

Our platform offers a user-friendly UI/UX interface, enabling traders to effortlessly build trading strategies through visual elements. They can then conduct backtesting to evaluate the performance of their strategies. Once satisfied with the results, traders can directly integrate with exchange APIs to execute their trading strategies.
